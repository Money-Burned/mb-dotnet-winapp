### How to run

[REPLACE WITH: An enumeration of simple, reproducible steps for people with a moderate basic understanding of IT to get the application up and running. It's a good idea to also add a short listing or shell snippet of how to fulfill these requirements in one go to make it easier to get started.]  

### How to develop

For information about the development process of this application please refer to the [development approach documentation](./doc/dev-approach.md).  

## Usage
