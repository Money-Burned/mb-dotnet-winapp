# Development approach of [your-repo-name]

## Framework or development platform used

- Origin and some background on the chosen framework/platform
- Links to further literature (official documentation / Wikipedia)
- What knowledge one should already have when choosing this framework/platform?
- Cost and license considerations in the context of the framework/platform

### Method of approach

- Why that framework?
    - Common benefits and/or disadvantages
    - Limitations ("only works on before high noon and below 20 degrees")
- Are there any dependencies on the operating system and if not, what do you have to consider if you want to run it on different operating systems?
- Are there any dependencies on other software in your code, e.g. libraries that you use?
- How much time should a developer plan to use/reimplement your approach?

### Development environment

- How do you set up a modern development environment for optimal development processes?
- Tools of choice

## Planning and software design

### Requirements

- What did you do to map the requirements to specific tasks to implement?
- Did you use user stories or requirements or both?
- To what extent have you broken it down?
- What requirements did you end up implementing?

- What special features that were not part of the requirements did you include and why?

### Modeling of data

- Outline the class model of the application if you use OOP; feel encouraged to use graphics like UML
- Outline the persistence of your application if it is implemented; feel encouraged to use graphics like ERM
    - Config data
    - Usage data

### Logic

- Outline how your internal processing is designed; feel encouraged to use graphics like flow charts or a state diagram!
- Did you externalize parts of your logic and why?

## Tutorial

Please write a guide on what steps a developer who is completely new to this framework/platform needs to do to build this or a similar application themselves.

## Some words about this file

In this document you can explain everything about your journey to create this software. Whatever it takes - just make sure that an interested reader is able to understand what you've done so far and how.  

It would be appreciated if you could at least briefly explain the above points. If you would like to write more and really go into depth, you are welcome to create additional separate files in the [doc directory](./) that deal with specific points in detail.
